# Webhooks

This is a simple Serverless project to get data from the Gitlab and GitHub APIs and store it in some DynamoDB schemas.

The goal of the project is to create a "history" of my career. Check how many commits I've created, how many pipelines I've run, and how much time I've invested.

Also, I want to get the commits and information from those webhooks and send it to some Discord/Slack channels.
